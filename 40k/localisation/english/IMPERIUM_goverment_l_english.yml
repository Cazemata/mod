#Origins
origin_gcs_imperium:0 "§HThe Great Crusade§!"
origin_gcs_imperium_desc:0 "The Great Crusade marked a brief era in human history of rebuilding, reunification and rapid technological advancement following the complete regression of Mankind into techno-barbarism during the 5,000 Terran years of the Age of Strife. It was a time when the Emperor of Mankind still lived in the conventional sense and led His people in person."
origin_gcs_imperium_description:0 "The Emperor Protects"
origin_commorragh_eldar:0 "Dark Eldar"
origin_commorragh_eldar_desc:0 "Dark Eldar are kindred to the Asuryani and other Aeldari, an ancient and advanced race of elf-like humanoids. Their armies usually have the advantages of speed and technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers. The Dark Eldar revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. Due to their use of the galaxy-spanning inter-dimensional labyrinth known as the Webway, they are extremely mobile, striking from seemingly nowhere, with little or no warning, and vanishing with their captives before significant military reaction can be mobilised. The Dark Eldar are unique amongst the races in the sense that they do not occupy many planets, but rather one dark city called Commorragh."
origin_craftworld_aeldari:0 "Aeldari"
origin_craftworld_aeldari_desc:0 "The Aeldari (the term for themselves before their race fell or Eldar are an ancient race of elf-like humanoids. Once they dominated the Galaxy but are currently a dying race. After the Fall of the Eldar they lost their main homeworlds and are currently scattered among the stars and webway in different factions and allegiences. The Ynnari are the members of a newly formed eponymous Eldar group that worship the God Ynnead and believe their race can be saved from the depredation of Slaanesh, Chaos God of Pleasure, by helping to bring about the birth of the slumbering god of the dead."
origin_tau:0 "T'au"
origin_tau_desc:0 "T'au is the homeworld of the Tau, and capital of the Tau Empire. It is located within the Ultima Segmentum, to the galactic north of Ultramar. Cities rise into the sky, covered in white marble, in stark contrast to the Hives of the Imperium. No humans have ever walked on the streets of the capital, located on the equator, and Imperial scans are blocked by some Tau technology. At the centre of this city appears to be a heavily defended fortress, possibly the heart of the Tau empire, the high council of the Ethereals."
origin_chaos_undivided:0 "Chaos Undivided"
origin_chaos_undivided_desc:0 "The Black Legion is a Chaos Undivided Space Marine Traitor Legion, formerly known as the Luna Wolves and the Sons of Horus, were the XVI Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. Once considered a large legion, the Black Legion were long considered numerically inferior to other Chaos Space Marine legions since their defeats in the great inter-Legionary wars, it is known that they recruit Marines from other Legions and renegade Chapters. At the time of the 13th Black Crusade, the fleet of the Black Legion has grown enormously, comparable to Imperial Navy Battlefleets in size."
origin_great_devourer:0 "Hive Fleet Tiamet"
origin_great_devourer_desc:0 "Hive Fleet Tiamet is a Tyranid Hive Fleet signs of which were encountered in M35 and is theorized to be a Tyranid implant-probe sent into the Galaxy ahead of the larger Hive Fleets. It is also unique, in that it has claimed the worlds of the Tiamet System without entirely stripping them of biomass and continues to guard its conquered territory with single-minded ferocity. When was encountered by an iperial pioneer flee the system contained seven life-sustaining worlds and a host of lesser planetoids. They surprisingly noted that every biosphere was infact a Death World swarming with dangerous life forms which managed to flourish despite whether the prevailing conditions were jungle, ice, desert or even airless rock. It was also discovered a continent-spanning organic conical structure, formed of chitin and soft encephalic flesh, that thrummed with immense psychic energy. Since then Tiamet system was fusion bombed on several occasions, but life was never fully extinguished."

origin_necron_rising_desc:0 "This smaller Nacron Dynasty woke up only to find its domains mostly destroyed by the eye of terror. With much rage, they now seek revenge on the Chaos Gods, and any of their worshipers."
origin_orkwaaagh:0 "Ork WAAAGH"
origin_orkwaaagh_desc:0 "Orks, their most notable characteristic is their love of fast vehicles and big guns. Even warbands that haven't given completely over to their love of speed will often have many bikes or vehicles in their force. This clan also contains more Mekboyz than most, and therefore they often field more mechanical creations than other clanz."

 civic_senatorum_imperialis_desc:0 "The Senatorum Imperialis (officially the Lords Temporal, Martial and Ecclesiarchical of the Most Divine and Righteous Imperium of Mankind) collectively form the Council of the High Lords of Terra. The Senatorum is an Imperial governing body led by twelve leaders of the most powerful organisations of the Imperium. This body rules the Imperium in the Emperor's name. The Senatorum itself is composed of tens of thousands of Imperial dignitaries, nobleman, lords, and other officials, but these rarely meet and instead the 'High Twelve' conduct the vast majority of affairs."
 civic_imperialcult_fanatics:0 "Imperial Cult Fanatics"
 civic_imperialcult_fanatics_desc:0 "The Imperial Cult, also called the Cult Imperialis in High Gothic, is the official and only state religion of the Imperium of Man. It is devoted to the worship of the Emperor of Mankind as the ascended divinity and saviour of humanity. Those who believe in the Cult's teachings hold that the Emperor is a living spiritual entity and the only true god of Mankind. The Imperial Cult is led by the Adeptus Ministorum, also known as the Ecclesiarchy, who devote their lives to spreading the Word of the Emperor and doing His will."
 civic_machine_cult:0 "Machine Cult"
 civic_machine_cult_desc:0 "The religion of the Machine God - is a complex and labyrinthine structure, a creed of secret rites and ceremonial processions that is never shared with outsiders. Within each Forge World the myriad ranks of Tech-priests vie for mastery in a world where only through the accumulation of technology and hoarded knowledge can one advance."
 civic_imperium_secundus:0 "Imperium Secundus"
 civic_imperium_secundus_desc:0 "The Imperium Secundus, known also as the Unremembered Empire, was the second stellar empire of Humanity created by the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman in 009.M31 during the Horus Heresy following the horrific events of the Battle of Calth and the Drop Site Massacre of Istvaan V. The Imperium Secundus was eventually folded back into the larger Imperium before the end of the Horus Heresy in 014.M31. It was later considered by Guilliman one of his greatest mistakes and an event that he was not eager for others to learn of once he was resurrected to serve as Lord Commander of the Imperium after the birth of the Great Rift in the late 41st Millennium."
 civic_horde_traditions:0 "Horde Traditions"
 civic_horde_traditions_desc:0 "Consummate horsemen and archers, these disparate tribes frequently fought one another for control of ancestral pastureland or - as their own ballads would have it - the sheer joy of battle. Chogorian armies had never invaded the Empty Quarter as the dry and desolate lands were of no value to the Palatine's people. However, the feudal nobles of the Palatine's state would often lead hunting bands into the steppes and take whole tribes east as slaves or capture a lone tribesmen to hunt through the mountains for sport."
 civic_barbarian_culture:0 "Barbarian Culture"
 civic_barbarian_culture_desc:0 "But the great lump of solid granite the Fenrisian tribesmen know as the polar continent of Asaheim always stands fast, a single, changeless continent on a world of fire, ice, ruin and torment. This extreme geography has resulted in the human population of Fenris becoming one composed largely of primitive, nomadic, barbarian tribes who barely approximate an Iron Age level of development. The tribes constantly seek secure territory, and as a result skirmishes and feuds over land between rival tribes are common. The Fenrisian people are hardened to the changes in temperature and environmental extremes, and so is the native fauna."
 civic_blacksmith_culture:0 "Blacksmith Culture"
 civic_blacksmith_culture_desc:0 "The vast eastern ocean of Nocturne, it is highly volatile, harbouring many black smokers and underground faults that erupt sporadically in spumes of super-heated water and steam from the ocean bed. Though it seems to be a strange place to live, the people along its coast have been moulded into stronger and more resilient forms. The Time of Trial also brings great rewards. Rich veins of gems and metals are revealed, enough to be mined by the people to pay for livestock and food on the interplanetary market. Tradition is revered strongly of Nocturne, especially the tradition of smithing, as is evident by the presence of numerous 'Great Forges,' all across Nocturne."
 civic_production_guilds:0 "Production Guilds"
 civic_production_guilds_desc:0 "The planet Kiavahr is populated by billions of workers and craftsmen, with huge fabrication plants and hive cities covering its surface. The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic from centuries of pollution and incidences of mutation are far higher than normal. This stretches the tolerance of the Adeptus Ministorum, but such is the quality and quantity of material that comes from the two worlds that more leeway is granted than would normally be the case."
 civic_interclans_rivalry:0 "Interclans Rivalry"
 civic_interclans_rivalry_desc:0 "Ferrus was eventually adopted by the Medusan clans as one of their own. He never interfered in the various clans' conflicts, believing that such competition was healthy for his people and should be allowed to thrive. Because of this impartiality, Ferrus was ultimately accepted universally as an honourary member of every Medusan clan, and great (often exaggerated) legends."
 civic_chosen_by_the_emperor:0 "Chosen By The Emperor"
 civic_chosen_by_the_emperor_desc:0 "The Emperor's ancient trust remains a potent honour for the Imperial Fists and their Successor Chapters in the present day. The Imperial Fists are the inheritors of the proud traditions of their Primarch Rogal Dorn, his name venerated by countless trillions across the Imperium."
 civic_tribal_culture:0 "Tribal Culture"
 civic_tribal_culture_desc:0 "Millennia before the founding of the Imperium, Baal and its two moons were all but destroyed in a terrible war. Ancient viral and nuclear weapons had turned the once idyllic worlds into toxic wastelands. The survivors became scavengers, constantly moving from place to place, and warring to preserve the spoils they gathered."
 civic_chivalric_traditions:0 "Chivalric Traditions"
 civic_chivalric_traditions_desc:0 "The human inhabitants of Caliban were forced to live in huge fortresses and castles located in clearings hacked from the forests of the planet. Cut off from Terra and the rest of Mankind's interstellar community by the Warp Storms that savaged the galaxy during the Age of Strife, human civilisation on Caliban devolved into a semi-feudal state, with most of the population ruled over by a small warrior elite who were very similar in function and form to the medieval European knights of Old Earth's ancient past."
 civic_i:0 "I Legion"
 civic_i_desc:0 "The Dark Angels are considered amongst the most powerful and secretive of the Loyalist Space Marine Chapters. They were the Ist Legion of the original 20 Space Marine Legions to be created during the First Founding of the 30th Millennium. Though they claim complete allegiance and service to the Emperor of Mankind, their actions and secret goals at times seem at odds with that professed loyalty, as the Dark Angels strive above all other things to atone for an ancient crime of betrayal committed over 10,000 standard years ago against the trust of the Emperor during the time of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. The Dark Angels stand first amongst the Space Marine Chapters, as they have done since their very inception as the Ist Legion. They are a proud Chapter, with traditions and rituals that date back to the earliest days of the Imperium of Man."
 civic_xiii:0 "XIII Legion"
 civic_xiii_desc:0 "The Ultramarines are considered one of the strongest and most honoured of all the Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium of Man, and were responsible for almost single-handedly holding the Imperium together after the Horus Heresy. Highly disciplined and courageous warriors, the Ultramarines have remained true to the teachings of their Primarch Roboute Guilliman for 10,000 standard years. The Ultramarines were originally the XIII Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy on the orders of Guilliman himself. The name 'Ultramarines' is a nod to both the Chapter's standing amongst the other Space Marine Chapters and their role as the source for the gene-seed of more Chapters of Astartes than any of the other former First Founding Legions combined."
 civic_ix:0 "IX Legion"
 civic_ix_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are one of the 20 First Founding Legions of the Space Marines and were originally the IXth Legion before the Second Founding broke the Legiones Astartes up into separate Chapters of 1000 Space Marines. They are well-known across the galaxy for their bloodthirsty nature in battle, and feared for the curse of flawed gene-seed they carry. The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-living of the Adeptus Astartes, with some of the Chapter's Space Marines having served the Emperor of Mankind for over a thousand standard years. Due to recent events, the Blood Angels' numbers were severely depleted. Under the threat of extinction, and in order to quickly replenish their numbers, the Blood Angels were forced to ask their kindred Successor Chapters from subsequent Astartes Foundings for a tithe of warriors from the related Chapters' pools of Neophytes, their candidate Space Marines."
 civic_x:0 "X Legion"
 civic_x_desc:0 "The Iron Hands are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the original First Founding Space Marine Legions created from the gene-seed of their martyred Primarch, Ferrus Manus. Like the other Loyalist Astartes Legions, the Iron Hands would later be divided up after the Horus Heresy into multiple different Chapters, as required by the Codex Astartes, although one Chapter of the original Legion remained known as the Iron Hands and is described below. Although unwavering in their faith in the Emperor of Mankind and His dream of human unity as embodied in the Imperium of Man, the Iron Hands also believe that human flesh is weak and easily corruptible, and strive to replace their organic bodies with more 'pure' bionic substitutes, thus closely emulating the faith of the Adeptus Mechanicus' Cult of the Machine."
 civic_vii:0 "VII Legion"
 civic_vii_desc:0 "The Imperial Fists are one of the First Founding Chapters of the Space Marines and were originally the VII Legion of the Legiones Astartes raised by the Emperor Himself from across Terra during the Unification Wars. The Imperial Fists stand out from other Space Marine Chapters since they possess no fixed homeworld, although they are most frequently based on Terra. Instead, the Imperial Fists rely on their 10,000-year-old mobile space fortress, Phalanx, to serve as their fortress-monastery. They maintain recruitment-chapels on various worlds spread throughout the Imperium. Part of the Imperial Fists' duties during the Great Crusade were to function as the Emperor's 'personal praetorians', accompanying Him everywhere. The Imperial Fists were usually used to strike a decisive blow against the enemies He confronted during that time. The role of the Emperor's bodyguards since he was mortally wounded during the Horus Heresy and interred within the Golden Throne at the heart of the Imperial Palace on Terra has now been entirely taken over by the Adeptus Custodes."
 civic_xviii:0 "XVIII Legion"
 civic_xviii_desc:0 "The Salamanders are one of the Loyalist First Founding Chapters of Space Marines. They originally served as the Imperium's XVIII Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy and for some time before the return of their Primarch were known as the 'Dragon Warriors'. Their homeworld is the volcanic Death World of Nocturne. The Salamanders as a Chapter are unusually concerned with civilian casualties compared to most other Space Marines and believe that one of their most important duties is to protect the lives of the Emperor of Mankind's innocent subjects whenever and wherever possible. This is an attitude that developed as a consequence of the Salamanders' own unusually close connections to the Nocturnean people, as they are one of the only Chapters of Astartes who continue to interact with their families and the people of their homeworld after their transformation into Space Marines."
 civic_xix:0 "XIX Legion"
 civic_xix_desc:0 "The Raven Guard is one of the original First Founding Chapters of the Space Marines and was originally the XIXth Space Marine Legion before the Second Founding and the adoption of the Codex Astartes. Named for a Terran avian seen by many cultures as the herald of fate and messenger of death, the Raven Guard have served the Emperor faithfully throughout the glories of the Unification Wars, the Great Crusade and the dark days of the Horus Heresy and beyond. From its earliest days, the warriors of the XIXth Legion were known as cunning and patient hunters, adept at biding their time until the moment to strike was at hand. When the Legion was united with its Primarch - Corvus Corax, the Raven Lord, the Deliverer, theirs was a form of warfare exemplifying speed, stealth and precision which was codified into their doctrine, and under the ivory-skinned, shadow-eyed and sable-haired Primarch, the XIXth Legion carved its name in the annals of the Great Crusade."
 civic_v:0 "V Legion"
 civic_v_desc:0 "The White Scars, who call themselves the 'Horde of Jaghatai' and were originally called the Star Hunters during the early Great Crusade, are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the First Founding Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. Known and feared throughout the Imperium of Man for their highly mobile way of war, the White Scars are considered the masters of the lightning strike and hit-and-run attack and are particularly adapted to the use of the Astartes Assault Bike as their mechanical steeds and their forces contain an unusually large number of Bike Squads compared to other Chapters. Bearing the ritual scars of bravery, these fierce warriors fight with all the tribal savagery that define the fierce steppe nomads of their homeworld Mundus Planus, known to them as Chogoris, bringing swift death to all of the enemies of the Imperium."
 civic_vi:0 "VI Legion"
 civic_vi_desc:0 "The Space Wolves, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka Fenryka or 'Wolves of Fenris', are one of the original 20 First Founding Space Marine Chapters, and were once led by their famed Primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VI Legion of Astartes raised by the Emperor at the dawn of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of their homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian culture as well as their extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's organisation. After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two Chapters: the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its parent Legion, and the second Chapter which took the name of the Wolf Brothers. The Wolf Brothers suffered from rampant mutation of their gene-seed not long after their Founding and were later disbanded. It is currently unknown if there are any other Successor Chapters of the Space Wolves in the Imperium."
 civic_khorne_cult:0 "Khorne Cult"
 civic_khorne_cult_desc:0 "Khorne is the violent, angry, and murderous God of Chaos. His creed of mindless, wanton destruction appeals only to the utterly psychotic and violent, which take to the battlefield with the unabashed urge to kill, burn, and maim. Because this overt behaviour makes them so noticeable, Khorne’s cultists are chased to the far fringes of the Empire, where the powers of Chaos can hold greater sway over the populace than the local governments. Organised cults dedicated to Khorne can only successfully operate where there are no real laws. The head of the cult is invariably an extremely powerful, merciless individual who goads his minions into battle with promises of blood and gore. The cults must behave like sharks — they must be constantly on the move, killing whenever possible. Cults of Khorne that cannot find enough innocents to massacre turn upon themselves in short order, both to sate the desires of their foul god and to appease its members’ own lust for death and chaos."
 civic_tzeentch_cult:0 "Tzeentch Cult"
 civic_tzeentch_cult_desc:0 "Those who follow the teachings of Tzeentch are dedicated to change in all its forms. They are the most mystical of the Chaos cults, seeking out forbidden knowledge regardless of the cost it exacts on the mind, body, and spirit. Hedge wizards, ex-priests, and those who dabble in the occult are the most likely candidates to be drawn into a cult of Tzeentch. The Colleges of Magic are constantly on the hunt for Cults of Tzeentch, viewing them as horrid aberrations that meddle in things that should be left alone. The Colleges engage in constant pogroms within their membership, rooting out those who have fallen sway to Tzeentch’s control. Although they are never spoken of, these fallen brethren are all too common. Magic is intrinsically tied to Chaos, and its practitioners are more vulnerable to the call of entropy and corruption than the average citizen of the Empire."
 civic_nurgle_cult:0 "Nurgle Cult"
 civic_nurgle_cult_desc:0 "Disease is an all too common aspect of life in the Empire. Many people live their entire lives suffering from one ailment or another, and almost every household has lost at least one immediate family member to a horrific illness. The cult of Nurgle preys on those who succumb to the grief and despair that result from this ever present disease and decay. In their madness, they come to believe that Nurgle offers some form of salvation or understanding of pestilence and the entropy of the world. Few realise their misguided convictions only fuel Nurgle’s power, creating a never-ending cycle of disease and despair. Cults of Nurgle recruit members from those suffering from horrible afflictions, nihilists, and those driven insane from disease or despair. Nurgle drives them to wander the Old World, spreading pestilence wherever they go. While most cultists eventually succumb to the numerous diseases they carry, a few become strangely energised by their afflictions, mutating into disgusting forms. Cultists of Nurgle are also remarkably cheery — Nurgle is seen as a 'loving' god who teaches his followers to accept the diseases that mar their body as a sign of his approval and grace."
 civic_slaanesh_cult:0 "Slaanesh Cult"
 civic_slaanesh_cult_desc:0 "Easily the most insidious and subtle of the Chaos cults, followers of Slaanesh are dedicated to serving their God through the subversion and corruption of others. Cultists are wanton hedonists who seek stranger and more perverse delights to shock their jaded senses into some kind of reaction. Over time, cultists lose all sense of morality or scruples, turning to murder and vile debauchery in the name of Slaanesh, the God of Pleasure. The cult of Slaanesh strives to insinuate itself in all levels of society. It is popular among the upper classes, the members of which often do not know exactly what it is that they are worshipping. In their quest for pleasurable moments, these misguided folk find amusement and novelty in paying homage to strange, seductive idols or partaking in debauched gatherings behind closed doors. Artists, poets, and other seekers of sensual things are often drawn to Slaanesh’s cults. Of them all, the cult of Slaanesh is probably the hardest to uproot, as the political fallout of revealing such heresy could topple the entire Empire."

Of all the worshippers of Chaos they follow Chaos in its purest form. They can interpret the meaning of Chaos in a variety of ways, including as a single god, worship the four major Chaos Gods equally, or favour one slightly over the others. The Chaos Lords and Daemon Princes of Chaos Undivided are at an advantage in their ability to unite any of the forces of Chaos under their leadership, even if they would normally worship opposing gods like Khorne and Slaanesh, so the warbands of Chaos Undivided are always the most diverse."

The Emperor's Children was the only Space Marine Legion to bear the Emperor's own name and His own icon - the Palatine Aquila - granted to them by His hand as a symbol of the Legion's martial perfection. Few were ever so honoured amongst the ancient Space Marine Legions and given less cause to betray the Master of Mankind than the Emperor's Children. Given the plaudits and accolades accorded them, few could doubt that they were the embodiment of what the Emperor had intended the Legiones Astartes to be: noble in action and aspect, excelling in all matters, strong, civilised, firm of purpose and loyal to the core."

The Iron Warriors, who were originally the IVth Legion of Space Marines, specialized in the breaking of sieges and assaults on static fortifications, which made them great rivals of the Imperial Fists Legion, said to construct the greatest static defenses in the Imperium. It was this rivalry between the Legions, and between their Primarchs Perturabo and the Imperial Fists' Rogal Dorn, that helped turn the Iron Warriors to Chaos. Like the members of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Loyalist Iron Hands Chapter, the Iron Warriors have a strong predilection for replacing parts of their body with cybernetic enhancements. When struck with a mutational 'gift' from the Ruinous Powers, most Iron Warriors simply cut off the mutated appendage, if possible, and replace it with a mechanical one."

 civic_xv_desc:0 "The Thousand Sons are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines who are sworn solely to the service of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of Change, Intrigue and Sorcery, though they were once the Imperium of Man's XV Legion of Space Marines. The main feature that distinguishes the Thousand Sons from the other Traitor Legions is the sheer number of psyker mutations that have always existed amongst the Space Marines in this Legion. Every current member of the Legion possesses psychic abilities and they prefer to use Chaos Sorcerers and guile in combat, relying on their psychic powers and sorcerous knowledge to earn them victory. As a result of an ancient spell known as the Rubric of Ahriman that was cast soon after the Thousand Sons fell from their homeworld of Prospero during the early days of the Horus Heresy, every Thousand Sons Astartes that lacked psychic powers had his soul fused directly into his Power Armour. The Thousand Sons have become living embodiments of sorcery animated by the power of Chaos and the will of the Lord of Change."
 civic_xiv:0 "XIV Legion"
 civic_xiv_desc:0 "The Death Guard are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines. They worship and devote themselves exclusively to the Chaos God Nurgle and as a result of his mutational 'gifts' they have become Plague Marines; Astartes who are eternally rotting away within their Power Armor and infected with every known form of disease and decay but who are immune to all pain or minor injury. When the XIVth Legion was first raised on Terra by the Emperor during the First Founding, its Astartes were known as the Dusk Raiders. After the XIVth Legion was reunited with its Primarch Mortarion on the world of Barbarus, he renamed the Legion the Death Guard. The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion entirely steeped in the power of Nurgle, the god of death and plagues, their very essence the epitome of all that vile Chaos God stands for. Their bodies are hives of filth and decay, their ﬂesh eternally rotting away even as it is renewed by the ceaseless process of death and rebirth."

The Word Bearers were also the first Space Marine Legion to be corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos many Terran decades before their counterparts turned to the Dark Gods. Through their actions they corrupted the Warmaster Horus and brought on the terrible galactic civil war of the Horus Heresy in all its savagery.

The World Eaters, originally known as the War Hounds, were also once the XIIth Legion of the twenty First Founding Space Marine Legions, and one of the first to betray the Emperor of Mankind for the service of Chaos and the Warmaster Horus. This Legion was a collection of nearly inhuman monsters long before Horus became corrupted and monsters they would remain, only with what little remained of their restraint and their humanity stripped away after their fall to Chaos."
 civic_xvi:0 "XVI Legion"
 civic_xvi_desc:0 "The Black Legion is a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines that is the first in infamy, if not in treachery, whose name resounds as a curse throughout the scattered and war-torn realms of humanity. The Black Legion was once one of the 9 First Founding Legions of Space Marines who turned Traitor to the Imperium during the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium. The Black Legion, at that time still known as the Sons of Horus, became the primary instrument of its Primarch, the Warmaster Horus, to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind and seize control of the Imperium in the name of Chaos. Such are the crimes of the Black Legion that it is easy to forget that the past was very different, and that there was a time when its Astartes and their perfidious master Horus were lauded above all of the other warriors of the Legiones Astartes, and were considered the most favoured servants of the Emperor of Mankind."
 civic_xx:0 "XX Legion"
 civic_xx_desc:0 "The Alpha Legion is the Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legion about whom the least is known. The Alpha Legion was once the XXth Legion of Astartes created during the First Founding by the Emperor of Mankind to carry out His Great Crusade to reunite all of humanity in a new golden age under His rule. They are experts in infiltration, covert operations, misdirection and diversion tactics, and their armies contain many Chaos Cultists and other mortal agents in addition to regular Heretic Astartes. The Alpha Legion's Primarch was named Alpharius, and was actually one of the identical twin Primarchs Alpharius Omegon, two brilliant and secretive sons of the Emperor, one of whom was reportedly later killed after the end of the Horus Heresy by Roboute Guilliman, the Primarch of the Ultramarines. Despite its seeming allegiance to Chaos, a closer scrutiny of the Alpha Legion's known history indicates that their seeming service to Chaos Undivided might actually be the greatest deception they have played upon the Imperium."

 civic_viii_desc:0 "The Night Lords were originally the VIIIth Legion of Space Marines created during the First Founding and became one of the 9 Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy of the 31st Millennium. They do not worship any of the four Chaos Gods individually, but acknowledge them equally in the form of Chaos Undivided as they ruthlessly spread terror and fear amongst the galaxy's inhabitants. The Night Lords are experts in the use of terror tactics to win battles and demoralise their foes before the main combat even begins. The Night Lords are synonymous with terror and murder, for their favoured mode of warfare is the unfettered application of brutal, overwhelming force. They show no mercy whatsoever, eschewing all subtlety and guile for wanton bloodshed and destruction. While such an approach might appear mindless, at one time it was different."

The Red Corsairs were once a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter called the Astral Claws who were based on the world of Badab Primaris in the Badab Sector of the Ultima Segmentum. The Astral Claws were, ironically, raised during the 10th Founding in the 35th Millennium to guard against the numerous daemonic and alien threats emerging from the Maelstrom. Under the leadership of their Chapter Master, Lufgt Huron, the 'Tyrant of Badab', in the late 41st Millennium, the Astral Claws sought to have the Badab Sector secede from the Imperium of Man. This was in protest against the Imperium's continued attempts to use the resources of the Badab Sector outside the region to fill the pockets of greedy Imperial merchants and manufactoria rather than dedicating them fully to the defeat of the Chaos and xenos threats that menaced the Maelstrom Zone."

They were convinced that they no longer had anything to fear from the galaxy at large, and they may have been right, but the real danger came from within. For those Aeldari who yet survive, war is their only hope. Their foes - both new and old - lack the technology, wisdom and skill of the Children of the Stars; in numbers alone are their enemies insurmountable.

Indeed, when they do retreat, Blood Axes will in fact return with larger numbers. They trade with humans for wargear and vehicles, and have even worked as mercenaries for the Imperium at times (such as during the Massacre at Big Toof River). All of these things lead followers of other klanz to brand them as dangerously treacherous, cowardly, and downright un-Orky! Most Blood Axes are back-stabbing 'Kommandoz', essentially serving as Ork special operations troops. Blood Axes wear combat fatigues and forage caps in shades of green and drab colours, commonly in camouflage patterns.
